### 👋 About Me
Hi, I’m Márton (Marci)—a data scientist, recovering competitive swimmer, and all-round ML tinkerer.  
By day I design **Monte-Carlo macro-financial simulations, AI strategy workshops, and stress-testing pipelines** for Europe’s banking system. By night just swimming :)

Most of my professional work lives behind the firewalls of the European Central Bank and industry clients, so **only a small slice ends up on GitHub**. Still, feel free to browse the open repos below or reach out if something sparks your curiosity!

### 🧳 Currently
- **Stress-Test Expert Analyst, Data Science & Quant Modelling — European Central Bank** (Feb 2024 → now)  
  - 10 000-path Monte-Carlo stress scenarios, multi-agent RAG automation, and AI opportunity mapping across 109 banks.  
- **Part-time Data Scientist — Pannon Business Network**  
  - Shipping Hungarian speech-to-speech assistants & computer-vision QC for smart-factory lines.

### 📂 A Few of My Projects on Github
| Repo | Peek Inside |

| **ECBERT** | Fine-tuning ModernBERT on monetary policy sentiment analysis. |
| **Bayesian_Project** | Spatio-temporal Bayesian modeling of ozone concentrations using STAN and hierarchical priors. |
| **Non-parametric-Stats-Project** | GAM, Mann-Whitney, Kruskal-Wallis & friends. |
| **Applied-Statistics-Project** | Functional data projections using GPs, LSTM, Prophet, KMeans, and polynomial/LOESS smoothing. |
| **NLP-Project-mimic-ChatGPT-with-Orca** | Fine-tuning Orca-Mini to imitate ChatGPT responses on a niche corpora. |
| **NBA_shot_analysis** | Tableau-based dashboard to explore how NBA scoring patterns shift by location and context. |
